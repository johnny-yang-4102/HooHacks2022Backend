This is the backend portion of the HooHacks project. The static build of the front-end was placed in this repository.

HoosYourFit is a website our team created to match UVA students that are most compatible with each other in terms of several user preferences and stats.
These factors include:
1. age
2. days preferred
3. weights
4. years of experience

Then, the user is taken to a list of potential matches who have different compatibility ratings. The user can then swipe right or left to match or not match respectively.

A full version of this app is here: http://hoosyourfit.tech/

Note: Chrome may automatically include http secure connection (http(S) - hence the 's'). You may want to use another browser such as microsoft edge.
